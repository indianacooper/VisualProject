# VisualProject
Project 1 of Visualization and Visual Analytics with Tommy Dang

## Data Set
This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in life expectancy at birth by race and sex. If you are interested, the link to the CDC website can be found [here](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth/w9j2-ggv5).

## The Code
Our class was intructed to create a time series visualization using the JavaScript library D3. I have no experience using D3, other than the tutorials in class, and I was excited to hop into the project. My application allows users to view this data set and compare line graphs to make conclusions on the life expectancies of different groups. Here is a quick screenshot of the project.

## Findings
The data set that I chose had some very interesting trends. One that is more undestandable, however, is the steady increase of life expectancy over the past century. Because the likes of mordern medicine and lower crime rates, humans have been allowed to extend their lives to greater than ever before. On a slightly more deadly note, after using my application and inspecting the data, there is one year that far trumps all others with the lowest life expectancy over every demographic. 1918.

## 1918
This year immediately caught my eye after I was first able to plot the data from my Excel file. After doing research, I found out that 1918 was the year with the largest influenza outbreak in history with 33% of the world population contracting the disease. To find out more information on this event, follow this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/features/1918-flu-pandemic/index.html).

## Conclusion
This project held many roadblocks for me and caused me to not complete this project as far in advance as I would have liked. However, I have gained a large amount of experience in D3 and a refresher in JavaScript.
